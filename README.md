## üêû Known Issues

### Network Connectivity on Android (Play Store)
- **Issue**: On some Android devices (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S22, Google Pixel 4), the app fails to connect to the Supabase backend when installed via the Play Store, resulting in a "TypeError: Network request failed" error. No requests are logged in Supabase, indicating the issue occurs before the request leaves the device.
- **Devices Affected**:
  - Samsung Galaxy S22 (inconsistent‚Äîsome devices work, others don‚Äôt)
  - Google Pixel 4
  - LG G4 (likely due to Android 6.0, API 23, being below the minimum SDK of 24)
- **Workaround**: The app works correctly when installed via APK, suggesting a Play Store delivery or device-specific issue.
- **Steps Taken**:
  - Added network diagnostics (e.g., `checkInternetConnection`, raw `fetch` tests to Supabase and Google) to confirm the issue.
  - Attempted to apply a network security configuration to allow requests to `ydxbhxstbspjpncpsmrz.supabase.co`, but encountered a `PluginError` with the custom plugin.
  - Manually applied the network security config by prebuilding the Expo project and modifying `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Test the new build with the network security config on affected devices.
  - If the issue persists, explore using a `fetch` polyfill (e.g., `whatwg-fetch`) or investigate Play Store app signing issues.
