Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in your React Native app:

  Step 1: Create a "Forgot Password" Screen
  First, you'll need a new screen where users can request a password reset. This screen will have an email input and a button.


  Step 2: Call the Supabase API to Send the Reset Email
  When the user submits their email, you'll call supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail. You must provide a redirectTo URL, which will be the
  deep link back into your app.


  Step 3: Handle the Deep Link
  You will need to configure deep linking in your Expo app. When the app is opened from the reset link, you'll need to detect the presence
  of a refresh token in the URL and navigate the user to a new ResetPasswordScreen.


  Step 4: Create a "Reset Password" Screen
  This screen will have two password inputs ("New Password" and "Confirm") and a button to submit the change.

  Step 5: Update the User's Password
  When the user submits their new password, you'll call supabase.auth.updateUser to set the new password.

  I can walk you through creating the necessary files and code for this.
